## Homework 4

### Requirements

- Write your solution in the files Problem_1.R and Problem_2.R. All other files will be ignored and will _not_ be graded!
- Make sure that your code runs _without errors_. Solutions that throw errors will receive 0 points. Make sure that your code runs without errors in a clean session to avoid failures when your code is executed on another machine. In R-Studio open Session, select Clear Workspace. Run all your code in one go and look in the R console for errors.
- Only submit relevant code and comments. Superfluous code/comments will lead to score reduction.
- Make sure that you submit _readable_ code. Follow the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html). Hard to read code will lead to a score reduction. 
    You can ignore (2.1 Object names) of the style guide.
- Before submitting, select all text in the file (in R Studio), open the Code menu and select Reformat Code.
- Do not submit code that executes install.packages. If you need to install packages, put a comment at the start of the line with install.packages before submitting.
- Unless explicitly required, remove lines that print objects before submitting.
